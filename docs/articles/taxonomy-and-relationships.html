<p>3 types of relationships can be derived from the OMOP Vocabulary tables:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<a href="#taxonomy">Taxonomy</a>: hierarchical parent-to-child relationships represented by <em>Is a</em> or <em>Subsumes</em> predicates.<br>
</li>
<li>
<a href="#mapping">Mapping</a>: <em>Maps to</em> or <em>Mapped from</em> relationships between OMOP concepts that either a.) represent a mapping from a non-standard vocabulary to a standard controlled vocabulary such as NDC to RxNorm or b.) represent a mapping from a deprecated concept to its most current counterpart.<br>
</li>
<li>
<a href="#lateral-relationships">Lateral</a>: non-hierarchical relationships between OMOP concepts represented by all other relationships.</li>

<p>The ancestry of 4115276 is derived and ordered in a top-to-bottom format. The CONCEPT_ANCESTOR table provides 2 types of paths: the <code>min_levels_of_separation</code> and <code>max_levels_of_separation</code> that represents the minimum and maximum distances between the concepts within the hierarchy, respectively. Here, the minimum is used.</p>
